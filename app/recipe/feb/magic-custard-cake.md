# Chocolate Soup

This is perhaps one of the richest, yet most beautiful desserts... it's simple and simply elegant at the same time. The sweet crunch of cinnamon toasted brioche croutons with rich, smooth, deep chocolate flavours!

## Ingredients

- 4 medium eggs
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 150 g vanilla caster sugar
- 110 g unsalted butter, melted
- 120 g plain flour
- 480 ml whole milk
- 1 orange
- 2-3 passion fruits

# Instructions

1. Separate the eggs, saving both yolks and whites
2. Whisk the whites to a stiff peak with a tiny drop of lemon juice.
3. Beat the egg yolks with the vanilla sugar and 1 tablespoon of warm water for a couple of minutes… you’re best off using a hand mixer. Beat in the melted butter and zest of the orange.
4. Mix the flour into the egg yolk mix, then stir through the milk.
5. Fold in the egg whites (in two batches), until evenly combined.
6. Preheat an oven to 160°C. Pour the batter into the baking tin and cook for 50-60 minutes until the top is golden and puffed and the middle is set but with a generous wobble.
7. Allow to cool completely (at least 3-4 hours) before slicing into the cake
8. Serve the slices of cake drizzled with the passionfruit pulp and finished with a sprig of mint!
